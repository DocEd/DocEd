## About Me

I'm a doctor and academic working in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine based in North London.
My academic role is as an NIHR clinical lecturer at UCL where I am interested in the re-use of electronic health records for research.
Particularly where research goals may be challenging to answer under traditional frameworks because anticipated effect sizes are very small, that its too expensive, or there are concerns over equipoise.

I am currently working on 2 major projects:

1. Physiological trajectories of sepsis in critical care. In particular:
    - Accounting for informatively missing data as a methodological consideration using [joint models](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/jm.html).
    - The impact of [oxygen](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/rccm.201904-0849OC) as a longitudinal treatment effect.
2. [DECOVID](https://www.decovid.org): a research platform to use secondary use data to inform treatment options in COVID-19.

I am a proponent of reproducible research and open data and am undertaking a fellowship with the Software Sustainability Institute to explore the use of synthetic patient data to facailite these goals in clinical research.
