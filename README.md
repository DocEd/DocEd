## About Me

I'm a clinician scientist finishing up my PhD at UCL.
My clinical background is in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine.
My thesis explores the secondary use of electronic health records for research goals that are perhaps challenging to answer under traditional RCT frameworks.
This might be because the signals are very small, that its too expensive, or there are concerns over equipoise.

I am currently working on 2 major projects:

1. Physiological trajectories of sepsis in critical care. In particular:
    - Accounting for informatively missing data as a methodological consideration using [joint models](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/jm.html).
    - The impact of [oxygen](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/rccm.201904-0849OC) as a longitudinal treatment effect.
2. [DECOVID](https://www.decovid.org): a research platform to use secondary use data to inform treatment options in COVID-19.

I am a proponent of reproducible research and open data and am undertaking a fellowship with the Software Sustainability Institute to explore the use of synthetic patient data to facailite these goals in clinical research.
